        <h3>566100</h3>
        <h3>Credit: 1</h3>
        <p>This course is the first of the computer science courses specifically designed for AET IT pathway students who wish to engage in an intensive study of computer science and information technologies. It is designed for students with no programming experience. The course will cover object-oriented programming, graphics and animation, GUI interfaces, arrays and files, sorting, recursion and ethics. The programming language is JAVA. All AET IT students will be required to design, develop and conduct multiple programming and research projects while attending the AET.</p>

        <h3>668000</h3>
        <h3>Credit: 1</h3>
        <p>This course is the second in the series of computer science courses designed for AET IT pathway students. This is a college-level, fast-paced course that completes the course outline of the College Board’s AP Computer Science program. The course emphasizes many extended lab procedures and has elements of research and design. Course content includes sorting algorithms (selection, insertion, merge, quick and heap) and data structures (arrays, recursion, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, sets, maps and graphs). The programming language is JAVA. Students have the opportunity to take the AP Computer Science exam in May with the possibility of earning college credit.</p>
