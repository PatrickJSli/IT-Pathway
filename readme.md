## Customer Requests
During a meeting with Mr. Lewis, he requested the following changes:
* Detailed information about the program and specific classes should not be included.
* There should not be any sections relating to applying to ACL
* The curriculum descriptions should be general and not go into the the specifics of the class, in part because much of the curriculum for AET is still in development

## Status
* Incomplete features as of now:
    * Faculty photos
    * Calendar events automatically appear in the home page events section
    * Club information
    * Calendar that can retrieve information from the county's Calendar
* Time needed to complete said features:
    * Some can only be completed with proficient knowledge of JavaScript (ex. the calendar), but the others should only require one more class period.
* Help needed: none.
